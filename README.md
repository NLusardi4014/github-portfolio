Sk8 Escape
Folder: Sk8 Escape Files. 
Sk8 Escape is a C# semester long group project. This game is a 2D side scroller focusing on dodging obstacles though well timed jumps. 
I worked on much of the core game loop, along with the player character, conrols, and scoring.
I also worked on the obstacles, assisting with the file storage and working mostly on the math and functions required to make them move and hit the player


Drifting Through Space
Link: https://people.rit.edu/npl5471/235/project3/ 
Drifting Through Space is an HTML classwork project. This is a simple 2D puzzle platformer where a lost astronaut must push off of their surroundings to reach a safe point.
I worked on this project alone, focusing on js function.
Worked on HTML and CSS as well to make the game presentable, although any art or vfx were free assets


Torchlit Abyss
Folder: Torchlit Abyss Shareable
Torchlit Abyss is a group project board game. This was a physical interpretation of a rougelike, with many different combat encounters, along with weapons and items to collect that can improve combat ability This project was focused on design, being a physical game. 
I worked on the combat system, helping to create the basis for both player and enemy combat turns.
I also spent a good amount of time creating and balancing weapons, along with the systems required to accomodate weapons such as looting


Personal Project
Folder: Personal Project
As a person with ADHD, I like to have something to do to move my hands so that I can pay attention. One of the main ways I do this is through this project. 
This is a collection of different character concepts using games that I am familiar with. I usually start with a very simple idea that revolves around the quote, “What if I made this idea for this game?” 
While I have a ton more less developed ideas, the one in this portfolio is one of my most complete concepts. It contains:
- Character details
- Basic ability concept
- Detailed ability stats (All numbers assosiated with each ability)
- Prototype in game summary
- Detailed backstory
